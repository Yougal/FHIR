    <h3>Implementation Guide documentation for {{currentIG.description}}</h3>
</div>

<p>This section of the Guide is the documentation.</p>

<p>The Table of Contents (TOC) is displayed as a tree on the left side of the screen. Selecting an item will display the contents
in this pane. Documentation contents must be HTML - for example a Google document that is maintained separately to the guide.
(Note that the TOC also includes the FHIR artifacts that are a part of this Guide)</p>

<p>To add a new documentation node, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Determine what the Url to the page is (it must be accessible from the Internet)</li>
    <li>Select the 'parent' node in the tree. The page you insert will become a 'child' of that node.
        For a 'top level' page select the 'Documentation' node.
    </li>
    <li>Click the plus ( <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus clickable"></i>) symbol at the top right of the tree. A dialog box will appear.</li>
    <li>Enter the Url to the page you are adding.</li>
    <li>In the dialog, enter the page title (which will appear in the Table of Contents) and the Url of the page. Click
    save to save.</li>
    <li>The TOC will be updated.</li>
</ol>
<p>The other options for editing the TOC are:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled" style="margin-left: 8px">
    <li>
        <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-edit clickable iconSpacing"/> - shows the dialog where the title and url can be changed
    </li>
    <li>
        <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove clickable iconSpacing"/>
        Remove the page from the TOC. Note that this doesn't delete the page, just the reference in the TOC.
    </li>
    <li>
        <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-down clickable iconSpacing"/>
        Moves the selected item down the TOC (Unless it is already at the bottom).
    </li>
    <li>
        <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-up clickable iconSpacing"/>
        Moves the selected item up the TOC (Unless it is already at the top).
    </li>
    <li>
        <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus clickable iconSpacing"/>
        Inserts a new page into the TOC as a child of the currently selected item.
    </li>
</ul>
